/**Ideas:
1) Every ... 20 pixels along the created path add a square cobblestone image 20 pixels in length --- This will create the path that the mobs will walk on.
2) Mobs follow path, update their position by 10 places along the path per timestep.
3) Get the mob movement working before placing the towers.
4) Tower ideas: Image as button, if you click the button, a opaque circle that shows tower radius is shown, tap again to place the tower.
5) Add collision detection with basic rectangles.
6) Add throwing mechanics using object based programming.**/
